We want to welcome everyone to the world's first lightning conference in Southeast Asia. We will have the largest representation of bitcoiners from around the region sharing their individual stories about what theyâ€™ve built and what the plans are for the future. Southeast Asia consists of a population of 685M with 70% of it being unbanked or underbanked, with Vietnam leading the region with the greatest percentage of unbanked at 70%.
