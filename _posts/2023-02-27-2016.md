[^1]: This development [began](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/21/launch_segwit_testnet/) with a research effort by Bitcoin Core developer, Dr. Pieter Wuille, initially focused on addressing transaction malleability, a longstanding and well-known concern and priority. However, in the process of this research, and in the narrowing toward a solution, additional properties of the solution were discovered that allow for increasing the block size while also simultaneously opening up some incredibly exciting secondary benefits. This effort was initiated by Dr. Pieter Wuille, but included contributions from many others, with particular thanks to Eric Lombrozo, Johnson Lau, Alex Morcos, Nicolas Dorier, Bryan Bishop, Gregory Maxwell, Peter Todd, Cory Fields, Suhas Daftuar, and Luke-Jr. Popular wallets and supporting libraries have stated they will support Segwit including Ledger, Trezor, Electrum, and Bitgo.

[^2]: Outlook: "The release of Version 0.12 will be a major move forward for the Bitcoin Core client. However, there is still much more to do and we’re always looking for more contributors. For more details see our contributing page https://bitcoincore.org/en/contribute/"
